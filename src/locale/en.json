This will not only require that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you effectively utilize the various buildings along the trail.<br/>Success will require that you hire capable staff: Cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings and engineers to manage the important railroad line.<br/><br/>If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of this great western trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game."
